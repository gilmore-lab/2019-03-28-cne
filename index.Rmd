## What to do about it?

# 4 realms and their interactions

---

<img src="img/nested-causality.jpeg" height=500px/>

---

| Realm               | Domain               |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| $W$   | The world |
| $B$   | The body |
| $N$   | The nervous system |
| $M$   | The mind |

## Nested causality

- Mind ($M$) within nervous system ($N$)
- Nervous system ($N$) within body ($N$)
- Body ($B$) within world ($W$)

## Mutual coupling of dynamic states

$\dot{M} = f(M,N)$

$\dot{N} = f(N,B)$

$\dot{B} = f(B,N,W)$

$\dot{W} = f(W,B)$

## Measure

- $W$, $B$, $N$ **directly**
- At varied spatial & temporal scales

## $S \rightarrow R$ psychology

- $S$ (stimulus) -> $R$ (response)
- $S$ and $R$ observable

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(igraph)
el <- rbind(c("W","S"), c("S","B"), c("B","R"), c("R","W"))
g0 <- graph_from_edgelist(el)
g0$layout <- layout_in_circle
plot(g0, vertex.size=50, vertex.color="gray")
```

---

- $S$ is the effect of some $W_i$ on $B$
- $R$ is some change in $B$ ($\dot{B_i}$) that is observable in $W$

## $S \rightarrow C \rightarrow R$

- $S$ (stimulus) -> $C$ (cognition/computation) -> $R$ (response)
- $C$ inferred from structure in $S$->$R$
- $C$ elaborate, probably innate
- $S$ alone insufficient to explain $C$, especially language [(Chomsky, 1959)](http://cogprints.org/1148/1/chomsky.htm)

## The cognitive 'revolution'

- $C$ ($M$) viewed in *algorithmic* terms
- Formal operations on information structures
- Developed in parallel with computer science, AI

## The cognitive (neuroscience) 'revolution'

- Developed alongside cognitive science
- $C (M) \leftrightarrow N$
- What $N_i$ compute functions of $C (M)$?
- Assume 1:1 relationship between $N$ and $C (M)$

## Linear/open-loop causal chains

- $S \rightarrow C \rightarrow R$

## vs. *closed-loop* causal chains

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#library(igraph)
el <- rbind(c("C","R"), c("R","W"), c("W","S"), c("S","C"))
g <- graph_from_edgelist(el)
g$layout <- layout_in_circle
plot(g, vertex.size=50, vertex.color="gray")
```

---

$R$ (actions) create effects in the World ($W$)

$W$ states induce sensations ($S$)

$S$ affect $C$ (computations/cognitions)

$C$ affect $A$

...

## Consequences...

- Properties of $W$ downplayed, ignored
- Why are $S$ or $C$ causal but not $R$?
- *Variability* in behavior $R$ only noise
- *Origins* of $R$, $C$, $A$?
- $W \leftrightarrow B \leftrightarrow N$ reflect ontogenetic and phylogenetic history

1. Measure the speed of the flywheel.
2. Compare the actual speed against the desired speed.
3. If there is no discrepancy, return to step 1. Otherwise,
    a. measure the current steam pressure;
    b. calculate the desired alteration in steam pressure;
    c. calculate the necessary throttle valve adjustment.
4. Make the throttle valve adjustment.

## What is being controlled?

- Control illustrates the purposive dimension of behavior (Tolman)
- Perceptual states (PCT) vs. actions (Ecological psychologists, forward modelers)
- Mappings from $S \rightarrow R$ and $C \rightarrow C$ (cognitive control/executive functions)

## What do animals control?

## Internal states
    
- Hunger, thirst, activity/arousal level, temperature, ...

- Mental states (mood, thought processes)?

## External states
    
- Direction/position/motion of sensory organs
- Body postures, movements in space
- Emissions (e.g., sound)
- Secretions
    
## Visuo-motor pursuit

<!-- ## Fruitful lines -->

<!-- - Properties of $W$ and of $A$->$W$->$P$ -->
<!-- - Events in $W$ specified by multiple $P_i$ -->
<!-- - Topographic maps -->
<!-- - 'Fourier'-like mappings common -->

<!-- ## Fruitful lines -->

<!-- - Measuring 'controlled variables' in $N$ and $B$ -->
<!-- - Explains spontaneous (arising from $M$/$N$) behaviors -->
<!-- - Effects of responses to stimuli $S$ (events in $W$ or $\dot{W}$) are perturbations to existing set of controlled variables -->

## Challenges

- Deep 'theories of tasks' 
- Amenable to control variable analyses

Krakauer et al., 2017

## Criteria for task selection

- Ethological relevance
- Transparent control variables
- Measurable state spaces
- Rich 'computational' theory of the task

## Peripheral control points

- Vision: direction of gaze, eyes open/closed, pupil diameter, lens thickness
- Audition: head position, ears covered/un-, acoustic/stapedius reflex, outer hair cells in cochlea 

## Locomotion

- Foundational example of "knowing" (Turvey)
- Systematic, often rhythmic changes in body configuration
- Produce forces that propel organism
- Control variables: speed, heading direction, posture

## Embedded within locomotion

- Perceiving a 'locomotable' trajectory
- Perceiving stable body posture

## Perceiving a 'locomotable' trajectory

- From vision/audition -> surface layout
- From kinesthesia -> body orientation relative to contact surface

## Constraints on 'locomotable' trajectory

- Wide enough to permit passage of body (geometric properties)
- In general direction of desired heading (geometric properties)
- Direction toward or away depending on valence of target(s)

[Fajen & Warren 2003](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0096-1523.29.2.343)

## Constraints on 'locomotable' trajectory

- With suitable supporting surface (friction, support rigidity, size)
- With sufficient 'clearance' to avoid collision or injury

## Controlling speed

- From proprioception -> energy expenditure, limb movement rate, respiration and heart rate
- From vision -> optical flow (as a function of distance)
- From audition -> change in heard azimuth, elevation
- From vestibular sense -> $\int{\ddot{x}dx}$

## Perceiving stable body posture

- From vestibular sense -> linear and angular head accelerations (gravity +)
- From kinesthesia -> body configuration and Center of Mass (CoM)
- From kinesthesia -> base of support

## Perceiving surface layout (visually)

- Stabilize gaze direction (despite head/body movements)
- Regulate binocular fixation
- Sample visual field
- Regulate optical focus

## Stabilizing gaze direction

- Vestibulo-ocular Response (VOR)
- Optokinetic Nystagmus
- Pursuit
- Saccades & microsaccades

## Controlling posture

- Righting reflex (relative to gravity)
- Myotatic reflexes (relative to target joint angle configuration)

## Challenges

- Characterizing states
- Characterizing state transitions
- Is bigger better?

$P(\theta,\phi,\bar{\lambda},t,V_{x},V_{y},V_{z})$. 

---

$(V_{x},V_{y},V_{z})$: locations in $W$

$(\theta,\phi)$: optic axis, usually aligned with $V_{z}$

$\bar{\lambda}$: wavelength distribution

## Challenges

- Most biologically meaningful events are multimodal
- Handling mixtures of (within or between mode) perceptual signals?

---

e.g., object distance from vision (monocular, binocular, motion cues, ...)

object distance from audition, olfaction, proprioception, or

body posture from vision, vestibular proprioception, muscle/joint proprioception

---

$P(t)=\sum_{i=1}^n w_{i}(t)S_{i}(t)$

$\sum_{i=1}^n w_{i}(t) = 1$

## Challenges

- Characterizing statistics of the perceptual environment...
- Natural scene statistics

## Visual motion statistics differ across age due to

- Changes in body posture (crawling vs. walking)
- Locomotor speed
- Increasingly stable gaze

## Even earlier ontogenetic origins

- Spontaneous activity
- In retina (e.g., Shatz)
- In muscles (twitching; Blumberg)

## Challenges

- Behaviors sequential, multivariate
- Mixtures of control laws...

---

Crawl/walk to mom + keep balance + stabilize gaze + look around + ...

---

$A(t)=\sum_{i=1}^n w_{i}(t)F_{i}$

$\sum_{i=1}^n w_{i}(t) = 1$

## Challenges

- Temporal delays
- Info from simultaneous events propagates at speeds differing by 100x
- Need theory of 'psycho/neural' relativity?
- Comparable challenges for output streams

## Open science will accelerate discovery

- Open sharing of materials, analysis code, & data
- Causal/dynamic models in discoverable formats
- Video + physio + other temporally dense time series?
