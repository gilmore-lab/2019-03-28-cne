B.F. Skinner

## $S \rightarrow R$ psychology

- $S$ (stimulus) -> $R$ (response)
- $S$ and $R$ observable
- $S$ is the effect of some $W_i$ on $B$
- $R$ is some change in $B$ ($\dot{B_i}$)

Noam Chomsky

## $S \rightarrow C \rightarrow R$

- $S$ (stimulus) -> $C$ (cognition/computation) -> $R$ (response)
- $C$ inferred from structure in $S$->$R$
- $C$ elaborate, probably innate
- $S$ alone (from $W$) insufficient to explain $C$, especially language, [(Chomsky, 1959)](http://cogprints.org/1148/1/chomsky.htm)

## The cognitive 'revolution'

- $C$ ($M$) viewed in *algorithmic* terms
- Developed in parallel with computer science, AI

## The cognitive (neuroscience) 'revolution'

- Developed alongside cognitive science
- $C (M) \leftrightarrow N$
- What $N_i$ compute functions of $C (M)$?
- Assume 1:1 relationship between $N$ and $C (M)$

## Linear/open-loop causality

- $S \rightarrow R$ 
- $S \rightarrow C \rightarrow R$

## vs. *Closed-loop* causality

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(igraph)
el <- rbind(c("C","R"), c("R","W"), c("W","S"), c("S","C"))
g <- graph_from_edgelist(el)
g$layout <- layout_in_circle
plot(g, vertex.size=50, vertex.color="gray")
```

---

$R$ (actions) create effects in the World ($W$)

$W$ states induce sensations ($S$)

$S$ affect $C$ (computations/cognitions)

$C$ affect $A$

...

## Consequences of a $S \rightarrow R$ and $S \rightarrow C \rightarrow R$ focus

- Properties of $W$ downplayed, ignored
- Why are $S_i$ or $C$ causal but not $R_i$?
- *Variability* in behavior $R_i$ only noise
- *Origins* of $R$, $C$, $A$?
- $W \leftrightarrow B \leftrightarrow N$ reflect ontogenetic and phylogenetic history

# Closing the loop

## Perceptual Control Theory (PCT)

Powers, 1973

---

<img src="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/sites/thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/files/mansell.jpg" height=500px/>

Powers, 1973

## Tenets of PCT

- *Perception* is the source of controlled variables
- *Actions* control perception with respect to some referent signal
- Nested hierarchies of perceptual control systems

---

<img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1383762112000586-gr1.jpg" height=500px/>

[(Wang et al. 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sysarc.2012.06.004)

<!-- Hierarchical control illustration -->

---

## Related approaches

- Dynamic Systems Theory (DST) (Van Gelder)
- Ecological Psychology (e.g., Gibson, Turvey)
- Forward models
- Cognitive control/Executive functions
- Reafference, Helmholtzian 'unconscious inference'

## What is being controlled?

- Perceptual states (PCT) vs. Actions (Ecological Psychologists, forward modelers)
- Control illustrates the purposive dimension of behavior (Tolman)
- Mappings from $S$ to $R$ and $C$ -> $C$ (cognitive control/executive functions)

## What do animals control?

## Internal states
    
- Hunger, thirst, activity/arousal level, temperature, ...
- Mood
- Thoughts
- ...

## External states
    
- Direction/position/motion of sensory organs
- Body postures, movements in space
- Emissions (e.g., sound)
- Secretions
    
## Locomotion

- Foundational example of "knowing" ($A$->$W$->$P$) (Turvey & Shaw)
- Change body configuration
- Produce forces that propel organism
- Control variable(s) are speed, heading direction, posture
    
## Embedded within locomotion

- Perceiving a 'locomotable' trajectory
- Perceiving stable body posture

## Perceiving a 'locomotable' trajectory

- From vision/audition -> surface layout
- From kinesthesia -> body orientation relative to contact surface

## Constraints on 'locomotable' trajectory

- Wide enough to permit passage of body (geometric properties)
- In general direction of desired heading (geometric properties)
- Direction toward or away depending on valence of target(s)

## Constraints on 'locomotable' trajectory

- With suitable supporting surface (friction, support rigidity, size)
- With sufficient 'clearance' to avoid injury

## Controlling speed

- From proprioception -> energy expenditure, limb movement rate, respiration and heart rate
- From vision -> optical flow (as a function of distance)
- From audition -> 
- From vestibular sense -> $\int{\dot{x}dx}$

## Perceiving stable body posture

- From vestibular sense -> linear and angular accelerations of the head (e.g., gravity)
- From kinesthesia -> body configuration and Center of Mass (CoM)
- From kinesthesia -> base of support

## Visual perception of surface layout

- Stabilize gaze direction (despite head/body movements)
- Regulate binocular fixation
- Sample visual field
- Regulate optical focus
- (Possibly) track moving target object

## Postural control

- Righting reflex
- Myotatic (stretch) reflex

## Visual object tracking

<img src="powers-5.1.png" height=500px/>

## Image stabilization

- Vestibulo-ocular Response (VOR)
- Optokinetic Nystagmus
- Pursuit
- Saccades & microsaccades

## Fruitful lines

- Properties of $W$ and of $A$->$W$->$P$
- Events in $W$ specified by multiple $P_i$
- Topographic maps
- 'Fourier'-like mappings common

## Fruitful lines

- Measuring 'controlled variables' in $N$ and $B$
- Explains spontaneous (arising from $M$/$N$) behaviors
- Effects of responses to stimuli $S$ (events in $W$ or $\dot{W}$) are perturbations to existing set of controlled variables

## Challenges

- Temporal delays
- Simultaneous events have different propagation speeds
- Vary over 2 orders of magnitude

```

## Challenges

- Deep 'theories of tasks' amenable to control variable analyses

---

<img src="img/powers-6.1.png" height=500px/>

Powers, 1973

## Challenges

- Handling mixtures of perceptual signals?

---

$P(t)=\sum_{i=1}^n w_{i}(t)S_{i}(t)$

$\sum_{i=1}^n w_{i}(t) = 1$

---

e.g., object distance from vision (multiple cues), audition, olfaction, proprioception, or

body posture from vision, vestibular proprioception, muscle/joint proprioception

## Challenges

- What are the statistics of the perceptual environment...
- Across ontogenetic development?

---

<img src="img/raudies-gilmore-2014.jpg" height=500px/>

## Challenges

- Mixtures of control laws...

---

$A(t)=\sum_{i=1}^n w_{i}(t)F_{i}$

$\sum_{i=1}^n w_{i}(t) = 1$

## Challenges

- Clear specification of controlled systems & control variables
- Widespread open sharing
- Imagine a 'meta-analysis' of control variables & dynamical relationships

## And yet...

1. An organism in some state of relative constancy ($\dot{B}<\epsilon$) is under the influence of one or more control systems.
1. $\dot{B}=f(B,N,W)$
1. For every $R_i$ ($\dot{B_i}$) there is some $S_i$ ($\dot{B_i}$ or $\dot{W_i}$)

# Our open science future

## Is there a reproducibility crisis in science?

- Yes, a significant crisis
- Yes, a slight crisis
- No crisis
- Don't know

## Why this matters

---

>"*The advancement of detailed and diverse knowledge about the development of the world’s children is essential for improving the health and well-being of humanity…*"

---

>"*We regard scientific integrity, transparency, and openness as essential for the conduct of research and its application to practice and policy…*"

## Open science will accelerate discovery

- Open sharing of materials, analysis code, & data
- Causal/dynamic models in discoverable formats
- Video + physio + other temporally dense time series?
- [Databrary.org](https://databrary.org)
