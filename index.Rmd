# Preliminaries

## Support

## Agenda

- $\Psi >> \Phi$
- 4 stances
- 1 stance, 4 realms
- Outside in
- Duality in description
- The road ahead

# $\Psi >> \Phi$

## But why?

## What to do about it?

# 4 stances

## Skinner

## Gibson

## Chomsky

## Bernstein (Lorenz?)

# 1 stance, 4 realms

## $A$

## $W$

## $P$

## $C$

# Outside in

## S-R

## S-O/C-R

- But can't account for *variability* in behavior, except as noise  

## Neuroscience needs behavior...

Krakauer

## Perceptual Control Theory (PCT)

## Circular causality & hierarchical control

# Duality in description

## Algorithms vs. dynamics

## Maps

# A cumulative science of minds, brains, bodies, & behavior

## PLAY

## Databrary

## Our open science future

# Outside in

## Cataloging hierarchical control

## Image stabilization
